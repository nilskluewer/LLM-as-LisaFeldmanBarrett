**(Setting: Dr. Sharma's office. It's a comfortable, softly lit room with two armchairs facing each other. Chloe is already seated, looking slightly anxious.)**

**Dr. Sharma:** Hi Chloe, thanks for coming in today. Please, make yourself comfortable. Can I get you some water or tea?

**Chloe:** (Fidgeting slightly) No, thank you, Dr. Sharma. I'm okay.

**Dr. Sharma:** Alright. So, on your intake form, you mentioned you've been feeling overwhelmed and under a lot of pressure since starting your semester abroad. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

**Chloe:** Yeah. It's… everything, really. It's a lot harder than I thought it would be. The classes are demanding, the language barrier is still challenging even though I studied it before, and I feel like I'm constantly behind.

**Dr. Sharma:** I understand. Starting something new, especially in a new country, can be incredibly challenging. What feels like the biggest source of pressure right now?

**Chloe:** Honestly? I think it's the expectations. My parents… they're so proud of me for getting into this program. They've sacrificed a lot to make it happen. I don't want to let them down.

**Dr. Sharma:** That's a very common feeling. You feel responsible for meeting their expectations, and that adds a significant weight. Do you feel like you're able to talk to them about how you're feeling?

**Chloe:** Not really. They're so excited for me; I don't want to worry them. I just keep telling them everything is great, even when it's not. I send pictures and talk about the fun parts.

**Dr. Sharma:** And what about the academic pressure itself? How are you coping with the workload?

**Chloe:** I'm trying, I really am. I'm spending hours in the library, but I feel like I'm not absorbing anything. My concentration is shot. I used to be a good student, but now I feel…lost.
I feel like I am drowing in all this readings and paperwork.
It is like a never ending circle.

**Dr. Sharma:** It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress, and that's affecting your ability to focus. Are you having any trouble sleeping or eating?

**Chloe:** Yeah, both. I'm either tossing and turning all night, or I'm sleeping for 12 hours and still feeling exhausted. And my appetite is all over the place. Some days I don't eat at all, and other days I just binge on junk food.
It feels like I am never going to be good enough.

**Dr. Sharma:** Those are classic signs of stress, Chloe. It's important to address them. Aside from your parents' expectations and the academic workload, are there any other factors contributing to your stress?

**Chloe:** I guess…making friends. It's harder than I thought it would be. Everyone seems to have already formed their groups. I feel really lonely sometimes. And I miss my friends back home.

**Dr. Sharma:** Loneliness can definitely exacerbate feelings of stress. Are you involved in any extracurricular activities or clubs here?

**Chloe:** I signed up for a couple, but I haven't really gone to any meetings. I just feel too tired and overwhelmed. I feel like I am always behind on my studies.

**Dr. Sharma:** I understand. It's a vicious cycle – the stress makes you withdraw, which then increases the loneliness and stress. Let's try to break that cycle. How about we start with small, manageable steps?

**Chloe:** Like what?

**Dr. Sharma:** First, let's focus on improving your sleep. Even a small improvement in sleep quality can make a big difference in your energy levels and concentration. Can you commit to establishing a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends? Maybe aiming for 7-8 hours?

**Chloe:** I can try. It's hard when I have so much work to do.

**Dr. Sharma:** I know. But think of it as an investment in your ability to do that work. We can also work on some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises, to help you fall asleep. Would you be open to trying that?

**Chloe:** Yeah, I think so.

**Dr. Sharma:** Great. Second, let's address the academic pressure. Are there any resources available at the university, like tutoring services or study groups?

**Chloe:** There are, but I feel…embarrassed to ask for help. Like I should be able to handle it on my own.

**Dr. Sharma:** Chloe, asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Everyone needs support sometimes, especially in a challenging situation like yours. It's okay to not be perfect. It is okay to ask for help.

**Chloe:** I guess you're right.

**Dr. Sharma:** We can also work on some time management techniques to help you break down your workload into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can help reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.

**Chloe:** That sounds helpful.

**Dr. Sharma:** And finally, let's address the loneliness. I strongly encourage you to attend at least one meeting of one of those clubs you signed up for. Just one. See how it goes. Even a small step towards connecting with others can make a difference.

**Chloe:** Okay. I'll try.

**Dr. Sharma:** Good. And how about we schedule another session for next week? We can check in on your progress and continue working on these strategies. We can also explore some cognitive techniques to help you challenge those negative thoughts about letting your parents down.

**Chloe:** That sounds good. Thank you, Dr. Sharma. I already feel a little bit better just talking about it.

**Dr. Sharma:** You've taken a big step today, Chloe. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll work through this together. It is importnat to be patient with your self.
Just take baby steps.

**Chloe:** Thank you. I appreciate that.

**Dr. Sharma:** You're very welcome. Now, before you go, let's take a few minutes to practice a simple breathing exercise. Just close your eyes…

**(Dr. Sharma guides Chloe through a short breathing exercise to end the session.)**
Is there any other thing you would like to share with me?
Sometimes writting down your thougts can help.

**Chloe:** Yes, I forgot to mention, sometimes I just feel like crying all the time.
Even the small things make me really sad.
I will try to write all down.

**Dr. Sharma:** That is very common. You are going through a tough time right now.
Remember I am here to help you.
Try to take some time for yourself.
Do you like sports?
Sometimes doing some exercises is good for your mental health.

**Chloe:** I love walking, there is a beautiful park near my house.
But, I am always so busy, I don't take the time to do this kind of stuff.

**Dr. Sharma:** I see, you could start with a 15-minute walk every day.
This is a good way to start.
Do you think you can try to do it?

**Chloe:** Yes, 15-min is doable. I will try to implement this in my daily routine.

**Dr. Sharma:** Perfect! I am sure you will get better.
Just be patient.
Do you have any questions for me?

**Chloe:** No, I am good. Thank you so much.
I will see you next week.

**Dr. Sharma** You are most welcome. Have a good week, and do not forget the breathing excercises.
See you next week.
