We are in the field of emotions classification here a short intro:

"""Intro
Emotion classification has long been a subject of interest in both psychology and informatics. Traditional models, such as Paul Ekman's theory of universal emotions, proposes the idea of six basic emotions: happiness, sadness, surprise, fear, anger, and disgust, each associated with distinct facial expressions recognizable across cultures \cite{ekman_emotions_2004, ekman_constants_1971}. This approach has influenced decades of research and the development of models that classify emotions based on predefined categories.

Lisa Feldman Barrett challenges this view by proposing the theory of constructed emotions. She argues that emotions are not biologically hardwired but are psychological constructs shaped by individual experiences and cultural contexts \cite{barrett_context_2022,barrett_theory_2016}. Barrett emphasizes the importance of context in emotion perception, suggesting that emotions lack universal "fingerprints" and that facial expressions alone are insufficient for accurate emotion recognition \cite{barrett_context_2011}.

In informatics, models like DialogueRNN, developed by \citeauthor{majumder_dialoguernn_2019} (2019), are designed to consider the flow of conversations and individual speakers' emotional states for improved emotion detection in conversations. This approach aligns with the recognition that context plays a crucial role in accurately classifying emotions. \citeauthor{poria_multimodal_2018} \citeyear{poria_multimodal_2018} demonstrate that incorporating contextual information, especially in multimodal sentiment analysis, leads to more accurate classifications compared to context-agnostic methods. For example, analyzing videos provides additional contextual cues from visual and vocal modalities, which can enrich emotion detection beyond what is possible with text alone.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The current state of emotion classification models fails to address the context-dependent nature of emotions as described by Lisa Feldman Barrett’s theory, resulting in oversimplification and depth in comprehending online emotional dynamics. This research aims to bridge the gap between advanced psychological theories and informatics by utilizing large language models to create a novel method for contextually rich emotion classification in online newspaper comments.


\subsection{Research Question}
To what extent can Large Language Models (LLMs), informed by Lisa Feldman Barrett's theory of constructed emotions, be utilized to produce contextually rich emotion classifications that align with human reasoning in the analysis of online user behavior, with effectiveness assessed through key factors such as coherence, comprehensiveness and theoretical alignment?

\subsection{Aim of Research}
This research aims to leverage the advanced capabilities of LLMs to address the shown research gap. By incorporating a comprehensive "context sphere" derived from users' online activities—including textual content, metadata, conversation histories, and broader discussion threads—the study seeks to produce emotion classifications that are contextually rich and aligned with state-of-the-art emotion theory by Barrett.

Core Affect and the Experience of Emotion
Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that emotions are not natural kinds, but rather are constructed experiences that arise from the interaction of core affect and conceptual knowledge.
Core affect is a neurophysiological state that represents an individual's constantly changing relationship to the world.
Core affect is experienced as feelings of pleasure or displeasure (valence), and to a lesser extent, as feelings of activation or deactivation (arousal).
Core affect is primitive and universal, but the extent to which individuals attend to and represent its properties as feelings can vary.
While core affect provides the raw materials for emotional experience, conceptual knowledge about emotion shapes how core affect is categorized and experienced. Conceptual knowledge about emotion comes from prior experience, language, and culture, and it is used to make sense of core affect in a particular situation.
Conceptual knowledge guides individuals to categorize their core affect as a particular emotion, such as sadness, anger, or fear.
The act of categorization transforms core affect into a meaningful experience, allowing individuals to make inferences about its cause and how to respond.
Classifying Constructed Emotions
According to Barrett, emotions are best measured and described using a multimodal approach that takes into account the individual's core affect, conceptual knowledge, and the specific situation.
Because emotions are constructed, they are highly variable, and there is no single, objective way to determine when someone is or is not experiencing a particular emotion.
Barrett cautions against relying on any single measure, such as facial expressions, to classify emotions, as these measures may not be reliable or specific. Instead, a multimodal approach that combines self-report with measures of physiological changes, behavior, and context provides the most comprehensive picture of an individual's emotional experience.
For classifying online comments, where physiological and behavioral data are not available, Barrett’s work suggests:
Focusing on language used in the comment to infer core affect.
Utilizing the rich context available, including user interaction history and metadata, to understand the commenter’s conceptual knowledge and the situation surrounding the comment.
While “perfect” classification may not be achievable, this approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the emotions expressed in online comments by considering core affect, conceptual knowledge, and context.
Important Considerations
Individuals differ in emotional granularity, which is the extent to which they differentiate between emotions. People high in emotional granularity describe their experiences using a wider range of emotion words, while those low in granularity tend to rely on more general terms like "good" or "bad." This difference in granularity may be reflected in the language used in online comments.
Emotion words can shape emotion perception. When individuals are provided with emotion words, they are more likely to categorize their core affect in line with those words. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the language used when classifying emotions in online comments.
While core affect is a key component of the experience of emotion, it is not the only factor. Situational and relational content also play a role. For example, feelings of anger might be experienced in response to a perceived injustice, while feelings of sadness might be experienced in response to a loss. When classifying online comments, it is important to consider the specific situation that prompted the comment, as well as the commenter’s relationship to the topic or other commenters.
By considering these various factors, it is possible to develop a more nuanced and accurate approach to classifying emotions in online comments.
It's important to note that classifying emotions is an ongoing area of research, and there is no single, definitive approach. Barrett's work provides a valuable framework for understanding the complexities of emotional experience and for developing more sophisticated methods for classifying emotions in online text.""""

"""Context for emotions classification in my context: Source 2
Here's a summary of Lisa Feldman Barrett's views on constructed emotions, core affect, and classification, along with relevant excerpts from the provided texts:Core Affect and Categorization:Barrett's theory posits that emotions are not discrete entities with distinct neural signatures but are constructed from more basic components, primarily core affect and conceptual knowledge.  Core affect is a continuous stream of feelings of pleasure/displeasure (valence) and activation/deactivation (arousal). These feelings are always present and are caused by various internal and external factors.  Emotions arise when we categorize these core affective feelings using our conceptual knowledge about emotions, which is shaped by past experiences, language, and culture.
“Core affect refers to consciously accessible elemental processes of pleasure and activation, has many causes, and is always present. Its structure involves two bipolar dimensions.” (1999)
“Core affect is distinguished from prototypical emotional episode. Core affect refers to consciously accessible elemental processes of pleasure and activation, has many causes, and is always present. Its structure involves two bipolar dimensions. Prototypical emotional episode refers to a complex process that unfolds over time...” (1999)
“We use the term core affect to refer to the most elementary consciously accessible affective feelings (and their neurophysiological counterparts) that need not be directed at anything.” (1999)
“Core affective feelings and their neurophysiological substrate are two sides of the same coin. Here we focus on the subjective feeling side, at the level of how people experience core affect and report that experience.” (1999)
“One of the clearest findings from the scientific literature dealing with emotion is that all instrument-based measures of emotion give evidence of a person's affective state.” (2006)
“Core affect is the ongoing, ever-changing state that is available to be categorized during emotion conceptualization, much like the visible light spectrum is categorized in color perception and physical movements in person perception.” (2006)
Classifying Emotions - A Nuanced Approach:Barrett emphasizes the need for a nuanced, multimodal, and context-rich approach to classifying emotions.  Because emotions are constructed, relying solely on physical signals (facial expressions, physiological changes) is insufficient.  Context, including internal bodily states, external environment, and prior experiences, plays a crucial role in shaping the meaning of these signals.  She advocates for incorporating as much contextual information as possible when classifying emotions.
“No one structure of description and assessment can do justice to this heterogeneous class of events without differentiating one type of event from another.” (1999)
“Far from it. The two concepts, prototypical emotional episodes and core affect, illustrate the diversity of events that fall within the class of emotions.” (1999)
“Scientists must abandon essentialism and study emotions in all their variety... We must assume variability to be the norm, rather than a nuisance to be explained after the fact.” (2017)
“If psychological meaning arises within a complex system of many weak, nonlinear, interacting causes, some of which are found only in the brain of a perceiver, then perhaps when you experienced terror or elation in Serena Williams’s furrowed eyebrows, pinched eyes, and gaping mouth, you were not recognizing an emotional display. Instead, you were constructing it.” (2022)
Classifying Online Comments:While Barrett advocates for including as much context as possible, she acknowledges that certain types of context, such as internal bodily states, are not always accessible. In your case of classifying online comments, you can still leverage the available contextual information, such as user interactions, metadata, and the content of the comments themselves, to make more informed classifications.  Focusing on core affect (valence and arousal) might be a useful starting point, recognizing that these are dimensional properties rather than discrete categories. You can also incorporate information about the situational and relational context embedded in the comments and user interactions.  While not perfect, this approach is more aligned with Barrett's theory than relying solely on pre-defined emotion categories.  It is crucial to acknowledge the limitations of this approach and to avoid reifying your classifications as representing discrete, essentialized emotions.  Instead, treat them as probabilistic inferences based on the available evidence.
