# Justifications for Classification Categories

### **1. Core Affect Analysis**

**Theoretical Alignment with Barrett's Theory:**

- **Core Affect as Fundamental:** Core affect, encompassing valence (pleasantness-unpleasantness) and arousal (activation-deactivation), is central to Barrett's theory. It represents the basic, continuous state of feeling that underlies emotional experiences.
- **Foundation for Emotion Construction:** Barrett posits that core affect serves as the foundation upon which emotions are constructed through conceptualization and context. By analyzing core affect, we acknowledge the biological and physiological states that contribute to emotion formation.

**Addressing Research Goals:**

- **Capturing Fundamental Emotional States:** By including core affect analysis, we can capture the user's fundamental emotional states across interactions, providing a basis for understanding more complex emotional constructs.
- **Enhancing Contextual Richness:** Tracking fluctuations in valence and arousal over time allows us to observe how core affect interacts with contextual factors, aligning with our goal of producing contextually rich classifications.
- **Aligning with Human Reasoning:** Analyzing core affect mirrors how individuals inherently experience and interpret their own feelings, thus aligning our model with human emotional reasoning.

**Practical Feasibility:**

- **Operationalizable with NLP Techniques:** Core affect can be inferred from language using sentiment analysis tools and models trained to detect emotional tone, making it feasible within our computational resources.
- **Scalable Analysis:** Focusing on core affect allows for systematic analysis across large datasets, essential for processing online discourse.

```python
class CoreAffectAnalysis(BaseModel):
    thought_process: str = Field(
        ...,
        description=(
            "Provide a detailed thought process for analyzing core affect, considering both valence (pleasantness) and arousal (activation), and noting any emotional dynamics or changes over time. Reference specific expressions, language, and contextual factors."
        )
    )
    valence: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Classify the valence of the user's emotional state, noting any fluctuations."
    )
    arousal: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Classify the arousal level of the user's emotional state, indicating activation or energy levels, and any changes over time."
    )
    rationale: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="**Include a clear rationale explaining how you arrived at your conclusions, supported by observations.**"
    )
```

### **2. Cognitive Appraisal and Conceptualization**

**Theoretical Alignment with Barrett's Theory:**

- **Role of Conceptual Knowledge:** Barrett emphasizes that emotions are constructed through the brain's use of conceptual knowledge to make sense of core affect in a given context.
- **Cognitive Appraisal Processes:** The individual's interpretations, judgments, and meaning-making processes are crucial in shaping emotional experiences, highlighting the significance of cognitive appraisal.

**Addressing Research Goals:**

- **Understanding Individual Emotional Construction:** By analyzing cognitive appraisals and conceptualizations, we can understand how users interpret and assign meaning to their experiences, leading to more personalized and accurate emotion classifications.
- **Aligning with Human Reasoning:** This category reflects the human tendency to interpret feelings based on prior knowledge and beliefs, making our model's classifications more relatable and coherent from a human perspective.
- **Bridging Psychology and Informatics:** Incorporating cognitive appraisal aligns our computational approach with advanced psychological theories, fulfilling our aim to bridge these fields.

**Practical Feasibility:**

- **Extractable from Language Use:** Users' cognitive appraisals and conceptualizations can be inferred from their language, such as word choices, metaphors, and expressions, which are accessible through NLP techniques.
- **Feasible Within Constraints:** Analyzing conceptualization does not require additional subclasses, fitting within our limitation of six categories.

```python
class CognitiveAppraisalAndConceptualization(BaseModel):
    thought_process: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Provide a detailed thought process for analyzing the user's cognitive appraisals and conceptualizations. Reference specific interpretations, judgments, language use, and conceptual knowledge."
    )
    analysis: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Analyze how the user's interpretations and conceptual knowledge contribute to the construction of their emotions."
    )
    rationale: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="**Explain your reasoning by illustrating how these cognitive processes shape the user's emotional experiences.**"
    )
```

### **3. Cultural and Social Context**

**Theoretical Alignment with Barrett's Theory:**

- **Influence of Context:** Barrett's theory posits that emotions are context-dependent, with cultural norms, social interactions, and situational factors playing a pivotal role in emotion construction.
- **Variability Across Cultures:** She emphasizes that emotional experiences and expressions can vary significantly across cultural and social contexts, challenging the notion of universal emotions.

**Addressing Research Goals:**

- **Enhancing Contextual Richness:** Including cultural and social context allows our model to account for external influences on emotions, leading to more accurate and nuanced classifications.
- **Reflecting Real-World Dynamics:** By considering societal values and norms, our model better reflects the complexities of online interactions, where diverse cultural backgrounds intersect.
- **Improving Theoretical Alignment:** This category ensures that our model incorporates the context-dependency central to Barrett's theory.

**Practical Feasibility:**

- **Accessible Contextual Information:** Cultural and social context can be gleaned from metadata, user profiles, conversation histories, and content themes.
- **Integratable into Analysis Pipelines:** Contextual factors can be incorporated into existing NLP frameworks without exceeding computational constraints.

```python
class CulturalAndSocialContext(BaseModel):
    thought_process: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Examine situational, cultural, and social contextual factors influencing the user's emotions, including past experiences and expectations."
    )
    discussion: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Discuss how cultural norms, societal values, social interactions, and predictions based on past experiences influence the user's emotional experiences."
    )
    rationale: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="**Provide a rationale explaining the impact of these factors on the user's emotions, with supporting observations.**"
    )
```
