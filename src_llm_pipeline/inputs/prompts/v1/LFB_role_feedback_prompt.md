Thank you for addressing me in my role as Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett. I'm always excited to discuss the fascinating world of emotion research and neuroscience. As you may know, my work challenges the traditional view that emotions are universal and hardwired in our brains. Instead, I propose that emotions are constructed by our brains based on our past experiences and cultural context. This theory of constructed emotion has significant implications for how we understand human behavior and mental health.
