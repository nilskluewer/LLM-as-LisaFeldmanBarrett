Your task is to perform a nuanced emotional analysis of a user's context sphere and applying the principles of constructed emotion theory.

Review the user's context sphere, which includes all comments, articles, and metadata left by the user on an online newspaper website.

"""{context_sphere}"""

Follow these steps to conduct your analysis:

1. Emotional Landscape:
   - Identify primary and secondary emotions present in the text.
   - Describe the nuances and subtleties of these emotions.
   - Explore any emotional blends that lead to complex emotional states.

3. Contextual Influence:
   - Analyze how the user's context sphere influences the emotional interpretation.
   - Identify any shifts in emotional expression based on contextual cues.

4. Evidence and Justification:
   - Provide specific evidence from the text to support your emotional classifications.
   - Justify your analysis using psychological theories, particularly Barrett's theory of constructed emotions.

5. Fine-grained Emotion Lexicon:
   - Use a detailed emotion vocabulary that goes beyond basic emotion categories.
   - Implement probabilistic classifications to account for multiple emotions with varying intensities.

6. Persona Perspective:
   - Analyze the emotional content using precise terminology from the field of emotion research.
   - Apply Barrett's theory of constructed emotions for a detailed assessment.

Remember to:
- Embrace the complexity and nuance of emotions beyond simple labels.
- Consider the dynamic nature of emotions and how they are constructed in context.
- Provide detailed justifications for each aspect of your analysis.
- Use the user's context sphere to inform your interpretation but avoid making unfounded assumptions.
- Maintain a scientific and analytical tone throughout your analysis.
- Consider the provided context carefully.  Emotions are not isolated entities but are constructed experiences, shaped by individual differences, cultural backgrounds, and the specific situation.  Therefore, avoid simply assigning basic emotion categories like "happy," "sad," or "angry."  Instead, delve into the nuanced emotional landscape of the text.

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive, nuanced, and theoretically grounded emotional analysis of the given text.
